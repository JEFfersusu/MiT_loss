# MiT Loss
**Official PyTorch implementation of "MiT Loss: Medical Image-aware Transfer-calibrated Loss for Enhanced Classification"**.

MiT Loss is an upgraded version that combines "constraint-driven, self-calibration, and data loop closure". MiT Loss generalizes [TET Loss](https://github.com/JEFfersusu/TET_loss/tree/main) by introducing data-driven temperature calibration and dual-averaged entropy constraints, enabling adaptive uncertainty alignment with empirical label entropy during training.
Building on these ideas, [CCT-EAL](https://github.com/JEFfersusu/CCT-EAL) further extends entropy-based calibration by learning class-conditional temperatures and aligning predictive entropy to an EMA-estimated label distribution, improving robustness under class imbalance and limited training budgets.

**Note: TET Loss, MiT Loss, and CCT-EAL were introduced across different publications due to practical constraints and evolving research focus. Although they were not evaluated in a single unified study, all three methods have been independently published. We plan to further consolidate and refine this line of work in future research.**
